# About Me

## Manager README

I've put up a little [README](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kCuW3hcFpsL0YVOMlz1DWeTVZXfrSZQeTEgyj7BbCJo/edit#slide=id.p) to better describe myself as an engineering manager - who I am, what I value, how I operate, goals, strengths and weaknesses. It is / was a living representation. Feel free to take a look! Alternatively, you can just talk to me and learn more :)

## FAQs


2. **What are technical domain areas of strengths?**

    Microservices, API aggregators and API scaling systems, application protocols, Developer Experience (DevEx) - product thinking, platforms and tools, software delivery, observability, compute and operational systems, AWS, cloud computing, service oriented architectures, Platform systems and tools. Past specialities include - GNU tools, embedded systems, RTOS, CAD SDKs, reconfigurable microprocessors. 

3. **What would be an ideal role?**

    I enjoy leading teams of people as well as individualized work. While out of the box, I am looking for my next role as a people leader, I would be open to talking about other roles that might be a fit based on my experience. I do not believe a person's impact trajectory has to fit into very narrow / specific moulds. 

4. **What are some industry trends that I am most interested by?**

    I am currently pursuing hands on exploration of Generative AI systems. More specifically, I am excited the transformative power of this tech as leveraged in the cloud computing, enterprise and security domains. I am also keenly interested in Generative AI as used in media applications.

5. **Who would be good references?**

    I've worked with a number of people in a variety of roles. As references, I can provide the names of engineering managers and directors, product directors, product and program managers, individual contributors and designers, HR professionals and others.

6. **Backend or frontend?**

    I've typically cared more about the impact versus the methods to achieve the impact. That said, I've always enjoyed being a generalist and have managed full stack teams. I've worked on both frontend and backend systems. My deeper strength is more on backend engineering, but I ultimately care about the usability of products and have a passion for the last mile user experience.

## Artifacts from Work Experience

Here are a few artifacts from various roles in my career. I've also listed artifacts produced by _members of teams I led_ in order to provide insight into the nature of work on a specific team. Full credits go to respective individuals for the actual artifact.

I've organized artifacts by the role I held at the time the artifact was produced and included the names of the primary authors as well.
